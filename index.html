      <p>
        Open ONI is a community-maintained project forked from <a
        href="https://github.com/LibraryOfCongress/chronam"
        rel="nofollow">chronam</a>, the <a href="http://djangoproject.com"
        rel="nofollow">Django</a> application the Library of Congress used to
        make <a href="http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov"
        rel="nofollow">Chronicling America</a>. Chronicling America makes
        millions of pages of historic American newspapers that have been
        digitized by the <a href="http://www.loc.gov/ndnp/"
        rel="nofollow">National Digital Newspaper Program (NDNP)</a> browsable
        and searchable on the web. With Open ONI, we aim to enable individual
        state and library-based newspaper collections to provide the same
        capabilities and develop common features and improvements.

      <h2>Install</h2>
      <p>
        To evaluate the software, we recommend installing from the latest
        <a href="https://github.com/open-oni/open-oni/releases" 
        rel="nofollow">release</a>,
        <br>
        rather than checking out the latest changes on the <code>master</code>
        branch.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you're interested in more recent changes, check out the
        <code>dev</code> branch but be warned that we don't expect it will
        always be in a working state at this point.
      </p>

      <h3>Documentation</h3>
      <p>
        Documentation is available in the <a
        href="https://github.com/open-oni/open-oni/wiki" rel="nofollow">Open ONI
        wiki</a>.<br>
        <a href="https://github.com/open-oni/open-oni/tree/dev/docs"
        rel="nofollow">Production install instructions</a> are in progress on
        the <code>dev</code> branch.

      <h2>Support</h2>
      <p>
        Open ONI is currently not ready for general production use outside the
        institutions who have been able to provide time for developer
        participation and have deployed it individually. Documentation and
        changes to facilitate more standardized deployment are under active
        development, but maintainers can only provide a minimal amount of
        assistance while working on Open ONI part-time. Developers cannot be
        expected to provide extensive one-on-one support.
      </p>
      <p>
        We are glad to provide support specifically related to Open ONI, but
        anyone wanting to work with Open ONI should begin with some foundational
        knowledge of Linux, Docker, Apache, Python, Django, Solr, and
        MariaDB/MySQL. There are other resources and communities better suited
        to aid in getting started and familiar with those technologies, so
        general assistance with them falls outside the scope of what to expect
        Open ONI developers to provide.
      </p>
      <p>
        We ask that bugs and feature requests be submitted to <a
        href="https://github.com/open-oni/open-oni/issues" rel="nofollow">Open
        ONI on GitHub</a>. Please confine other questions and conversation
        about Open ONI development and use to <a
        href="http://bit.ly/openoni-slack-signup" rel="nofollow">Open ONI's
        Slack</a>. These guidelines are intended both to keep conversation in
        the open where it may benefit <em>all</em> of the Open ONI community and
        to protect developers' already limited time.
